# Enterprise Security Program

This document defines the security controls expected for the Metam Services platform repository. It separates controls that are already implemented in code from controls that must be enabled in vendor platforms.

## Control Map

| Layer | Tool | Purpose | Repository Status | External Setup Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PR security | GitHub Advanced Security | CodeQL, secret scanning, dependency review, pull request findings | CodeQL and dependency review workflows added | Enable Advanced Security, secret scanning, and push protection in GitHub settings |
| Dependency and container security | Snyk Enterprise | SCA, container, Dockerfile, Compose, and IaC remediation | Dependencies pinned and audit-clean locally | Add Snyk organization, token, project import, and policy gates |
| Code quality | SonarQube Enterprise | Maintainability, bugs, coverage, duplicated code, quality gates | No token-dependent workflow committed | Add `SONAR_TOKEN`, `SONAR_HOST_URL`, and quality gate policy |
| Cloud and IaC posture | Orca Security | Cloud, Kubernetes, image, and Infrastructure-as-Code risk | Docker and Compose files available for scanning | Connect cloud accounts, container registry, and repository integration |
| Runtime web testing | Burp Suite Enterprise | Authenticated DAST scanning for web routes and APIs | Routes can be scanned through staging | Configure staging URL, test users, scan profile, and exclusions |
| Independent assurance | Annual penetration test | External validation for enterprise customers and auditors | Recommended control documented | Contract third party and retain final report/remediation evidence |

## GitHub Advanced Security

Enable these repository settings:

1. Code scanning.
2. Secret scanning.
3. Push protection.
4. Dependency graph.
5. Dependabot alerts.
6. Dependabot security updates.

The repository includes:

- `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`
- `.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml`
- `.github/dependabot.yml`

Expected PR gate:

- CodeQL must complete without critical or high findings.
- Dependency review must block high severity vulnerable dependency changes.
- Any detected secret must be revoked, rotated, and removed from history if exposed.

## Snyk Enterprise

Recommended Snyk projects:

- Python backend dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Inventory AI service dependencies from `inventory-ai-service/requirements.txt`
- Frontend dependencies from `frontend/package-lock.json`
- Docker image from `Dockerfile`
- Docker Compose and deployment configuration

Required secrets:

- `SNYK_TOKEN`
- Snyk organization ID or slug

Policy:

- Block critical vulnerabilities.
- Block high vulnerabilities when a fix is available.
- Require explicit risk acceptance for unfixed high vulnerabilities.
- Scan containers before Docker Hub release.

## SonarQube Enterprise

Recommended quality gate:

- no new critical or blocker issues
- no new high security hotspots without review
- no new duplicated code above project threshold
- coverage trend must not regress for changed backend services
- maintainability rating must remain acceptable

Required secrets:

- `SONAR_TOKEN`
- `SONAR_HOST_URL`

## Orca Security

Recommended scan scope:

- cloud accounts
- Kubernetes clusters if used
- container images
- Dockerfiles and Compose files
- exposed services and network paths

Policy:

- database, Redis, and pgAdmin must not be internet-exposed
- production secrets must be stored in a managed secret store
- public services must sit behind TLS and a web application firewall

## Burp Suite Enterprise

Recommended authenticated scan coverage:

- login and session handling
- admin routes
- data hub upload and connector flows
- module APIs
- report routes
- role-based redirects and direct URL access

Use a staging environment with test-only data. Do not scan local production-like credentials.

## Annual Independent Penetration Test

Minimum scope:

- web frontend
- FastAPI backend
- authentication and authorization
- multi-tenant data isolation
- Docker and deployment configuration
- file upload and data connector attack paths
- API abuse and rate limit behavior

Deliverables:

- executive summary
- technical finding list
- severity ratings
- reproduction evidence
- remediation plan
- retest confirmation

## Current Residual Risks

- Local demo stacks may expose Postgres, Redis, and pgAdmin ports for developer testing.
- Demo credentials exist for local walkthroughs and must be replaced before external deployment.
- Frontend token storage should move from `localStorage` to hardened session handling for production.
- Vendor controls require paid platform setup and secrets that must not be committed to Git.
