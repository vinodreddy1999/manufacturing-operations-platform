# Metam Services (Python)

This repository is now a Python-only implementation of the Metam Services backend.

It uses FastAPI and includes runnable backend modules for Metam Services:

- Auth
- Platform
- Inventory
- Warehouse
- Supplier
- Procurement
- Production
- Maintenance
- Quality
- Reporting
- Supply Chain
- AI

It now also includes a modular-monolith platform foundation with:

- PostgreSQL-ready SQLAlchemy 2.0 models
- Alembic migration scaffold
- Tenant/company/plant isolation fields
- JWT/password security helpers
- Role and permission records
- Company-level feature flags
- Tasks, approvals, documents and audit logs
- Redis/Celery background job hooks
- Optional AI provider interface for future LLM copilot integrations

Application metadata is now stored in the database rather than only in process memory for the shared runtime paths. This includes:

- tenant metadata
- module definitions
- company and plant metadata
- warehouse, supplier, and inventory reference metadata
- inventory reservations, movements, counts, and mobile scan metadata
- procurement requisition metadata
- admin/data hub/company feature metadata

The Production module has been expanded into a dedicated backend package with product master, BOM, routing, work centers, lines, machines, production orders, MRP, reservations, scheduling, logs, downtime, WIP, losses, costing, reports, dashboard, task/notification queues, and rule-based Production AI.

The Maintenance module has also been expanded into a dedicated CMMS/EAM-style backend package with machine registry, capability configuration, maintenance plans, breakdown work orders, spare mapping/reservation/consumption, downtime, shutdown windows, assignments, vendors, documents, machine history, lifecycle, costing, reports, dashboard, MTTR/MTBF, health scoring, and rule-based Maintenance AI.

The Quality module has been expanded into a dedicated QMS-style backend package with quality plans, checklists, sampling rules, inspection lots, inspection execution, defects, quarantine, rework, rejection, scrap, CAPA, KPIs, reports, quality tasks/notifications, and rule-based Quality AI.

The Sales & Distribution module has been expanded into a dedicated ERP-style backend package with customer master, regions, territories, plant representatives, sales orders, finished goods availability, protected customer reservations, partial allocation, dispatch orders, shipments, returns, KPIs, reports, tasks/notifications, and rule-based Sales AI.

The Customer Portal module has been added as a dedicated external-user backend with isolated customer authentication, profile view/update requests, customer-owned order and shipment tracking, secure document downloads, support requests, return requests, notifications, reports, audit logs, and rule-based Customer Portal AI.

The Supplier Portal module has been added as a dedicated external-supplier backend with isolated supplier authentication, company-level portal enablement flags, supplier users/RBAC, supplier-owned purchase orders, acknowledgements, delivery confirmations, ASN, document/certificate uploads, supplier performance visibility, supplier-facing tasks, messages, CAPA responses, notifications, reports, audit logs, and rule-based Supplier Portal AI.

The Reporting & Analytics module has been added as a dedicated BI-style backend with standard report catalog, scoped report execution, CSV/Excel/PDF export flow, saved reports, scheduled email reports, dashboards, KPI definitions/snapshots, trend analytics, cross-module insights, action insights, and rule-based Reporting AI.

The Costing & Profitability module has been added as a dedicated cost intelligence backend with cost centers, cost elements, inventory valuation, landed cost, production costing, maintenance and quality costing, allocation rules, standard costs, variance analysis, profitability views, costing reports, dashboard cards, and rule-based Costing AI.

The Mobile Operations module has been added as a dedicated shop-floor/mobile backend with mobile authentication, device management, my-work dashboard, task/approval actions, scan resolution, inventory receiving/transfers/counting, warehouse movement, production updates, maintenance execution, quality inspection, dispatch operations, uploads, offline sync, audit logs, notifications, and rule-based Mobile AI.

The Integrations module has been added as a dedicated API/file/webhook/email integration backend with provider registry, company configs, masked credential storage, webhooks, inbound events with idempotency, sync jobs, mappings, file import/export, errors/retries, monitoring reports, email/machine hooks, and rule-based Integration AI.

The Manufacturing Intelligence module has been added as a future command-center backend that connects risks across Inventory, Warehouse, Procurement, Production, Maintenance, Quality, Sales, Costing and Forecasting with impact graphs, root-cause analysis, what-if simulation, health scores, customer/cost impact, recommendations, draft actions and executive summaries.

The Frontend & Admin Platform module has been added as a backend contract layer for future React/TypeScript screens. It exposes navigation, folder structure, admin dashboard, company setup, RBAC, dashboard access, data scopes, workflows, KPIs, alerts, notifications, security, documents, compliance, platform management, Manufacturing Data Hub, Planning, AI Command Center, Digital Twin and Digital Operations Center APIs.

- Module registry: `http://localhost:8000/modules`

## Frontend

A production-oriented React/Vite frontend is available in:

```text
frontend/
```

It uses live backend responses only. No frontend mock data is used.

Stack:

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS
- React Query
- Axios
- Recharts
- shadcn-style local UI components

Run locally:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

The frontend reads the backend URL from:

```text
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Build:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

Docker build and run:

```bash
cd frontend
docker build \
  -t vinodreddy1999/metam-services-frontend:latest \
  -t vinodreddy1999/metam-services-frontend:0.1.0 \
  .
docker run -p 8080:8080 vinodreddy1999/metam-services-frontend:latest
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Docker Compose also includes a standalone `frontend` service exposed on port `8081`.

Docker Hub push:

```bash
docker push vinodreddy1999/metam-services-frontend:latest
docker push vinodreddy1999/metam-services-frontend:0.1.0
```

## Full-Stack Application Image

The root `Dockerfile` now builds one deployable application image:

- React frontend is built with Vite.
- FastAPI serves both the backend APIs and the built frontend.
- The app listens on port `8080`.
- SQLite is used by default at `/data/metam.db` for a simple single-container run.
- `DATABASE_URL` can point to PostgreSQL for production or Docker Compose deployments.

Build:

```bash
docker build \
  -t vinodreddy1999/metam-services-fullstack:latest \
  -t vinodreddy1999/metam-services-fullstack:0.2.7 \
  .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run --name metam-fullstack -p 8080:8080 \
  -v metam_fullstack_data:/data \
  vinodreddy1999/metam-services-fullstack:latest
```

Seed full-scale multi-company demo data after the container is running:

```bash
docker exec metam-fullstack python scripts/seed_enterprise_data.py
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Seeded login accounts:

```text
Super admin: super@metam.local / SuperAdmin123!
Admin:       admin@metam.local / ChangeMe123!
User:        user@metam.local / User12345!
```

Expanded multi-company test accounts are also seeded for each company. Use the same role password by prefix:

```text
admin.apex@metam.local     / ChangeMe123!
manager.apex@metam.local   / Manager123!
operator.apex@metam.local  / Operator123!
viewer.apex@metam.local    / User12345!

Replace apex with coc, nova, fresh, or med to test each seeded company.
```

The backend also seeds full module records for Planning, Inventory, Production, Maintenance, Quality, Procurement, Sales, Costing, Compliance, Customer Portal, Supplier Portal, Reports, and Documents across every seeded company.

Walkthrough artifacts:

- `docs/metam-services-complete-working-walkthrough.html`
- `docs/metam-services-complete-working-walkthrough.gif`

Access model:

- Super admin has full access and can create or update other super admins.
- Admin is scoped to its own company and can manage only its company users, records, and DataHub metadata.
- User has read-only runtime access and cannot access DataHub.
- Disabled users cannot log in or call protected APIs.

Multi-tenant validation helper:

```bash
python scripts/validate_multitenant_access.py
```

Expected validation highlights:

- `admin@metam.local` only sees `company-c`
- `super@metam.local` sees all companies
- standard users receive `403` for DataHub routes

Runtime APIs added:

- `POST /runtime/auth/login`
- `POST /api/v1/runtime/auth/login`
- `GET /runtime/auth/me`
- `GET /runtime/users`
- `POST /runtime/users`
- `PUT /runtime/users/{user_id}`
- `GET /runtime/records`
- `POST /runtime/records`
- `PUT /runtime/records/{record_id}`
- `DELETE /runtime/records/{record_id}`
- `GET /runtime/inventory/items`
- `GET /runtime/analytics/summary`
- `GET /runtime/audit-logs`

## Docker Compose Stack

Run the full stack with PostgreSQL, Redis, backend API, full-stack app, standalone frontend, worker, nginx, and pgAdmin:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Default ports:

- `8080`: full-stack app (frontend + backend served together)
- `8081`: standalone frontend
- `8000`: backend API only
- `5432`: PostgreSQL
- `5050`: pgAdmin
- `80`: nginx reverse proxy

Compose notes:

- PostgreSQL is the primary metadata store in compose deployments.
- Services share the `metam-network` Docker bridge network.
- `seed-enterprise-data` runs once after the app is healthy and creates multi-company demo users and records.
- pgAdmin uses `admin@metam.localhost.com / ChangeMe123!` by default.

Enterprise endpoints:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /ready`
- `GET /live`
- `GET /metrics`
- `GET /traffic`
- `GET /info`
- `GET /swagger`
- `GET /openapi.json`

Enterprise roles:

- `super_admin`
- `account_owner`
- `organization_admin`
- `team_manager`
- `supervisor`
- `operator`
- `auditor`
- `qa_tester`
- `custom`
- `admin`
- `user`

Validate the running full-stack container:

```bash
scripts/validate_fullstack.sh
```

Docker Hub push:

```bash
docker push vinodreddy1999/metam-services-fullstack:latest
docker push vinodreddy1999/metam-services-fullstack:0.2.6
```

Docker Compose enterprise services:

- `fullstack-app`: integrated frontend + backend
- `platform-api`: backend-only API service
- `frontend`: standalone frontend service for split deployment
- `postgres`: PostgreSQL database
- `pgadmin`: PostgreSQL administration UI
- `redis`: cache and worker broker
- `worker`: Celery worker
- `nginx`: reverse proxy with security headers

Compose run:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

Kubernetes and Helm starter manifests are available in:

```text
deploy/kubernetes/
deploy/helm/
```

## Demo Login

Use `POST /auth/login` with:

```json
{
  "tenant_slug": "precision-components",
  "email": "admin@metam.local",
  "password": "ChangeMe123!"
}
```


## Inventory AI Service

A separate Python FastAPI microservice is available here:

```text
inventory-ai-service/
```

It provides rule-based inventory intelligence APIs for:

- risk center
- shortage prediction
- overstock prediction
- procurement recommendations
- expiry intelligence
- dead stock detection
- production impact
- optimization draft actions

Run it with:

```bash
cd inventory-ai-service
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8100
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8100/docs
```

The AI service is recommendation-only. It creates draft actions and requires human approval for critical actions.
